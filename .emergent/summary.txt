<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a company tracking dashboard called Growth Equity Fund Tracker.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- A professional, initially dark-themed (later changed to light-themed) UI.
- The main view is a horizontally scrollable data table built with TanStack Table v8.
- **Frozen Columns:** The left section (Company Name, Website, Sector, Category) must be sticky.
- **Column Groups & Interactivity:**
    - **Annual Data:** Revenue Range (e.g., 0M–0M).
    - **Company Offerings:** A multi-line summary of products/services.
    - **Quarterly Data:** A group header dropdown (Q1-Q4 FY25) to sync data across 5 sub-columns.
    - **Monthly Data:** A group header dropdown for the month, with 4 sub-columns (LinkedIn Followers, Headcount, Job Openings, Web Traffic). Each sub-column has an independent growth toggle (1M, 3M, 6M, YoY) and numeric filters.
- **Filtering:**
    - Inline dropdown filters for Sector and Category.
    - A filter for Revenue Range.
    - Numeric filters for monthly data (both raw value and growth %).
    - Filters should support min/max ranges.
- **Data:**
    - Start with dummy data for 10 companies, later increased to 30.
    - The sectors and categories for the 30 companies must be based on a user-provided reference sheet.
- **Functionality:**
    - An + Add Company button that opens a modal form.
    - The modal should only contain fields for Company Name and Website.
- **Column Changes:**
    - The Sub-sector column must be removed.
    - The Category column should be relabeled to Subsectors.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A functional frontend prototype of the Growth Equity Fund Tracker built with React and TanStack Table. The dashboard features a light-themed, professional design with a complex, horizontally scrollable table. Key features like frozen columns, interactive column group headers with selectors (for quarter/month), and multiple filter types (dropdown, numeric) are implemented. The application uses local state for all data, which is currently populated with dummy entries. An Add Company modal is also present.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was actively implementing a batch of user requests which included:
    1.  Removing the  column.
    2.  Relabeling the  column to .
    3.  Implementing min/max range filters for numeric columns.
    4.  Updating the  modal to only show  and  fields.
    5.  Expanding the dummy dataset to 30 companies, sourcing sectors and categories from a user-provided reference.
The agent's last action was to execute a  command to apply these changes to , , and .
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Complete and verify the latest user feature requests (P0)**
  - **Description:** The last agent action was writing multiple files to implement a set of critical user requests. The outcome of this action is unknown. The application may be in a broken or partially implemented state.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Finalize Implementation of User's Latest Requests (P0)**
  - **Description:** Implement a batch of user requests including removing the Sub-sector column, adding min/max filters, updating the Add Company modal, and expanding the dummy data to 30 companies.
  - **Where to resume:**
    1.  Verify the contents of , , and  to see if the previous  command was successful.
    2.  If the changes are incomplete or incorrect, re-implement them.
    3.  Crucially, update  with 30 realistic companies based on the user's provided reference sheet.
    4.  Implement the logic for min/max range filtering in .
  - **What will be achieved with this?** The dashboard will be fully aligned with the user's latest requirements, featuring the correct columns, filters, modal behavior, and expanded dataset.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
  - **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other upcoming tasks defined by the user beyond the current in-progress work.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Initial Dashboard Creation:** Built the foundational Growth Equity Fund Tracker dashboard with a dark theme, TanStack Table, frozen columns, and interactive data selectors.
- **Theme Redesign:** Successfully transitioned the entire application from a dark theme to a professional light theme based on user's visual feedback.
- **Filter Implementation:**
    - Added a dropdown filter for the Revenue Range column.
    - Implemented numeric filters for both the raw value and growth percentage in the Monthly Data columns.
- **Testing and Verification:** Conducted multiple rounds of testing using the screenshot tool and the automated testing agent to verify functionality after major changes.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The agent has been diligent in addressing all issues raised by the user or found during testing.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/UI
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a design-system-first approach using HSL-based CSS variables for theming.
- **Data Table:** TanStack Table v8 for creating the complex, interactive data grid.
- **State Management:** Local React state () for all application data (no backend).

**key DB schema**
- N/A. All data is managed in a local JavaScript object array within .

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Core component containing the complex table logic, columns, and filters. This file requires significant updates.
- : Contains all the company data. This file needs to be expanded to 30 entries.
- : The modal form for adding a company, which needs simplification.
- : The parent component that holds the state and orchestrates the dashboard.
- : Defines the application's light theme and design tokens.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  component is very large and handles a significant amount of logic for columns, headers, cells, and filtering. It could be beneficial to break down the custom filter components and complex header/cell renderers into smaller, reusable components.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A (Frontend only).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- You must start by verifying the result of the last agent's  command. The implementation of the latest user requests is half-done and needs to be completed and validated.
- The user's request for minimum and maximum filters is a new requirement. The existing numeric filters are greater than only. This functionality must be newly implemented.
- The expansion of dummy data to 30 companies is a critical task. The data should be realistic and conform to the sectors/categories provided by the user in a previous message.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Remove the subsector column. The category column should also have a filter with both minimum and maximum. (IN PROGRESS)
2.  **User:** In the add company modal, there should only be the website and the company name field. The category should be relabeled as subsectors. Please increase the number of companies to 30, strictly belonging to the sectors and categories within the provided sheet. (IN PROGRESS)
3.  **Agent:** (ACKNOWLEDGED) Okay, I will now update the files.
4.  **Agent:** (ACTION) Executed  to update , , and . (STATUS UNKNOWN)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** Potentially. The application was stable, but it is currently in the middle of a significant refactoring and data update. The success of the last file write operation is unknown, so the app may not compile or run correctly.
- **Mocked:** The entire application is a frontend prototype with mocked data. There is no backend connection.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- None.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (before the latest requests).
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None.
- **Known regressions:** None from previous work, but the current state is untested.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent was mid-execution. The key next steps are to **verify** the file writes, **complete** the implementation (especially the min/max filter and the data expansion), and then **test** the full suite of new changes.</analysis>
